BKgLib
===

This is **NOT a [Bukkit] plugin**, this is a library.

This library is used by my other Bukkit plugins, trying to use it for your own plugins will probably break your plugins and make the server unstable.

When you install one of my plugins there is no guarantee that the entire library will be available at runtime.
