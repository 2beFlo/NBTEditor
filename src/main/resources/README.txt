----- BUILD INFORMATION --------------------------------------------------------

Build Date: ${project.build.timestamp}
For CraftBukkit ${bukkit.version}

----- WARNING ------------------------------------------------------------------

This is NOT a Bukkit Plugin, this is a library.

This library is used by my other Bukkit plugins, trying to use it
for your own plugins will probably break your plugins and make the
server unstable.
When you install one of my plugins there is no guarantee that the
entire library will be available at runtime.
